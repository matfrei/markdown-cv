## Selected Projects

### LayerShuffle 
**Towards Distributed Vision Transformers.** Enhanced robustness in vision transformers through randomized layer execution, enabling arbitrary execution sequences and layer pruning without retraining. The underlying aim is to distribute transformer models onto a fault-tolerant heterogeneous distributed system of agents.
[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04513)][[code](https://github.com/matfrei/layershuffle)]

### CLIPMasterPrints  
**Adversarial Master Attacks for Contrastively Pre-trained Models.** Developed an adversarial master attack on CLIP-trained models using open-ended search in foundation model latent space, identifying a vulnerability caused by text-image modality gaps. [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03798)][[code](https://github.com/matfrei/CLIPMasterPrints)]

### MarioGPT  
**Open-ended Content Generation in Video Games.** Pioneered the use of large language models for open-ended text-to-level generation in video games, resulting in a playability rate of 88% for generated levels. [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05981)][[code](https://github.com/shyamsn97/mario-gpt)]
